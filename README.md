U of M Bootcamp Assignment 8: Liribot

Liribot is a Siri-like command-line app that fetches data from the internet.  It understands 3 basic commands:

1) my-tweets: Lists my last 20 Twitter tweets
2) movie-this: Lists information about a movie that you specify
3) spotify-this-song: Lists information about a song that you specify

Titles must be provided in quotes.  In addition, Liribot can read in commands from a file which must be called 'random.txt'
Simply separate the command from any titles with a comma and no additional spaces

Liribot will log all commands and the resulting output in a file called log.txt.
